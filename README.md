## Agilisium Conversational BI Bot on AWS
This Quick Start automatically deploys the Agilisium Conversational BI Bot on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 25 minutes. It provisions a web interface to interact with the BI bot by using AWS services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon Lex, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Cognito.

You can open a chat window on the bot website, converse with the bot, and enter questions about your data. The bot responds through a mix of visuals and text. This Quick Start uses an example scenario of an automotive dealership, where a business stakeholder—such as an executive—converses with the bot to derive sales and revenue insights of the dealership, based on a predefined set of questions.
